		  <h3>Relationship with Bahrain Government</h3>
		  <hr/>
		  <p>
		    Dragon Associates is a British PR and Strategic Communication firm (previously named <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171023073847/https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07696012">Woodmint Ltd</a>) that has a contract with the Bahrain International Circuit (where Bahrain's Formula One Grand Prix race takes place). While their work involves putting out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171019224008/https://adamcooperf1.com/2012/04/10/bahrain-hits-back-with-positive-lotus-report/">press releases</a>, they also forced the Guardian to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171012054511/http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/02/201229153055296176.html">take down</a> an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171019224319/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/30/bahrain-grand-prix">opinion piece</a> in January 2012 that claimed that the BIC's head of security had tortured at least one of the company's employees on the premises. With the exception of a superfluous addendum, the piece went back up unchanged - just after tickets for the Bahrain Grand Prix went on sale.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    It is not clear exactly when, and for how much money, Dragon Associates was hired, but it is possible that it took over the work that another British PR company <a href="new-century-media.php">New Century Media</a>, was originally contracted for by the BIC in August 2011. The current Managing Director of Dragon Associates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121013002355/http://dragonassocs.com/who_we_are.html">Charlie Methven</a> was Managing Director of New Century Media until June 2011.
