		  <hr/>
		  <p>
		    In December 2011 Hill + Knowlton was <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/407963-bahrain-tenders-dec2011.html#document/p9/a67148">hired</a> by Bahrain's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121009005955/http://www.gop.bh/">General Organisation of Sea Ports</a> to perform "PR Strategy Formulation & Implementation Services".

		  </p>
		  <p>
