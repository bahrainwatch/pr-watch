		  <h3>Relationship with Bahrain Government</h3>
		  <hr/>
		  <p>

In response, the AFL-CIO (the US's largest trade union federation) <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/406877-afl-cio-bahrain-fta-complaint.html">filed a complaint</a> with the US government 21 April 2011, calling on it to review its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain%E2%80%93United_States_Free_Trade_Agreement">Free Trade Agreement with Bahrain</a> in light of the mass dismissals and labour rights violations.
